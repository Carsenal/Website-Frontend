          <p>Hello! My name is Carson Riker. I am currently a high school senior at Quaker Valley High School, and will graduate in 2019. I am an enthusiastic people person, who is best defined by my love of creativity.</p>
          <p>Finally, a little about this page. I made this website by hand. I did not use any templates, and I did not have any help. I wanted to demonstrate my abilties, with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as my ability to design something visually appealing. (Like? Dislike? Rate me at the bottom of the page!) I also created this website to serve as my resume, facing the world. On this website, you can learn a lot about who I am as a person, but if all else fails, remember me by one fact: I love Northeastern.</p>
